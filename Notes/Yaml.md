# YAML - Yet Another Markup Languange

YAML files consists of maps and lists
Indentation matters and has to be consistent. Always use spaces
Maps are key value pairs:
    - name: value pairs
    - Maps can contain other maps for more complext data structures
Lists:
    - Sequence of items
    - Multiple maps can be defined in a list
